# Water_Resource_Management_Modelling
This repository contains a series of notebooks used in an ASALI training to introduce scientific Python Water Resource Management modelling. The scripts are developed by researchers from the Institute for Environmental Sciences (IVM), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

To run the notebooks in the cloud using Binder(https://mybinder.org) click on this badge: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MartheWens/Water_Resource_Management_Modelling/master) 

To run the notebooks locally you need to have python installed. We advice to use a Minicoda(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution and create a new conda environment using: conda env create -f environment.yml
